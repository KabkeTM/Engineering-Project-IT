# Engineering-Project-IT
Project for Engineering Thesis in IT

This project covers basic graphical effects that are used even today in video game inudstry. Those are: 
 - Posterization
 - Specific color palletes
 - Dithering
 - Decreasing the resolution

In the project you can find whole source code for the project, as well as some .exe for both Linux and Windows to show how the game works. Note that the game is merely made for represnting given effects not so much for gameplay. That can change in the future tho ;)
